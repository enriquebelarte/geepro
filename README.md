This code is completely based on original https://sourceforge.net/projects/geepro/ and this is just some correction to make it work in present distros.

I wanted some EPROM programmer software which would work on GNU/Linux and I found the above repo that seemed quite abandoned. Wine was not an option.

Following its README instructions I got an error in the first `waf configure` step:

```
ValueError: invalid mode: 'rU'
```

I was using python 3.11 but running `waf` with python 2.7 solved the issue.

After that one I got a linker related error:


```bash
[101/101] cxxprogram: build_directory/src/buffer.cpp.1.o build_directory/src/chip.cpp.1.o build_directory/src/dummy.cpp.1.o build_directory/src/storings.cpp.1.o build_directory/src/iface.cpp.1.o build_directory/src/files.cpp.1.o build_directory/src/parport.cpp.1.o build_directory/src/timer.cpp.1.o build_directory/src/protocols.cpp.1.o build_directory/src/script.cpp.1.o build_directory/src/checksum.cpp.1.o build_directory/src/cfp.c.1.o build_directory/src/main.cpp.2.o -> build_directory/geepro
/usr/bin/ld: /home/enrique/Proyectos/geepro_0.0.4/geepro/build_directory/gui-gtk/libgui-gtk.a(bineditor.c.1.o):(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `GuiBineditorColorsSet'; /home/enrique/Proyectos/geepro_0.0.4/geepro/build_directory/gui-gtk/libgui-gtk.a(gui.c.1.o):(.bss+0x0): first defined here
```

Could fix it changing the definition of `GuiBineditorColorsSet` at ```gui-gtk/bineditor.h``` as `typedef enum` instead of just `enum`.

After that everything built smoothly just by running :

```bash
python2 waf configure --prefix=/usr/local
python2 waf build
python2 waf install
```

Then ```geepro``` executable is available at ```/usr/local/bin```.

Hope it is useful for anyone looking for writing EPROMs.

** Tried to make it work with a USB SP200S board but it does not work.
